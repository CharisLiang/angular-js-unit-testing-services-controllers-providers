##How to run

- Ensure Node.js & npm are installed
- `npm install -g karma-cli` (to install the karma-cli package globally)
- `npm install` (to install the dependencies)
- `karma start` (to start karma and run tests)

The unit tests are written in Jasmine and are run by Karma using PhantomJS.
